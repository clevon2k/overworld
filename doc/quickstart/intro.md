# Quick Start Introduction

In this quickstart, we'll put together a simple chat application using
Overworld. This application will consist of two parts: a **server** which we
will build in Erlang, and a **client** which will be written in
[Godot](https://godotengine.com/).

We will implement a [Protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/) serialization for our
Chat protocol, automatically generate client and server bindings, and run a
chat application with a few clients.

[Creating the client](client.md)
